    "# Bias Amplification by Quantitative Misrepresentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of bias amplification by quantitative misrepresentation. This demonstration uses cheset X-ray images from the Medical Imaging & Data Resource Center (MIDRC) Open-A1 data set as the example, and provides you with the instruction on how to train and deploy the model, as well as visualize the amplified bias.\n",
    "Quantitative misrepresentation (i.e., data set skew) is systematically applied to the training set to simulate different levels of selection bias. Specifically, the data used during development are selected such that the disease prevalence varies between patient subgroups. The degree to which bias is promoted can be controlled by changing the degree to which the prevalence varies between subgroups.\n",
